      About Donavan
  </h1>

    <p>
        I  like to play video games, watch football, and hangout with friends.
    </p>

    <p>
      The games that I currently enjoy playing are Madden 23, Rainbow Six Siege, and any Call of Duty game.
    <p>
      I graduated when I was 16 years old from a charter school in Albuquerque, New Mexico Called Gilbert L. Sena.
    </p>
    <p>
      After graduation, I moved to Texas for a year and then moved back to Albuquerque for this bootcamp
